        <h3>Why Our Dry Cleaning is Truly <span>Organic</span></h3>
        <h4>Safe For You</h4>
        <p>Your garments will always be returned to you impeccably clean and free of any toxic substances. Our cleaning system detects the level of cleaning solution in the garments to ensure that they are completely solution-free.</p>
        <p>Our cleaning solution is non-toxic and does not contain perchloroethylene (PERC), a chemical traditionally used in dry cleaning that can adversely affect your skin, eyes, nose, throat, and nervous system. Our solution is classified as a non-hazardous air pollutant by the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a> and does not require labeling by <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a> for toxicity.</p>
        <h4>Safe for the Environment</h4>
        <p>Our solution is biodegradable, and does not contaminate the environment. By utilizing a modern purification system, we reduce the most solution waste and produce 100% clean solution for each load.</p>
        <h4>The Cleanest Results</h4>
        <p>Our cleaning uses the most advanced distillation system so that your garments are always cleaned in 100% purified solution. This also ensures that all the impurities and solutions are completely extracted from your garments.</p>
