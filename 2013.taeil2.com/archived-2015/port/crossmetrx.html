          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>CrossFit is a unique fitness program, in which coaches program workouts for their gym members. CrossMetRx helps coaches program daily workouts and keep track of their members. It also helps members keep track of their workouts and view their progress.</p>
          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>The first step was to put ourselves in their context. We went to a few sessions at CrossFit Milpitas. Afterwards, we ran contextual inquiries and interviews with both members and coaches. Here are some of our most interesting findings:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>When coaches do their programming, they do look at their past workouts to make sure they keep workouts varied.</li>
            <li>Coaches sometimes set specific benchmark goals for their clients and focus workouts around those goals.</li>
            <li>Members manually record their data into journals, and sometimes have to flip through pages to find their personal records (PRs).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The most important part of our research was watching the coaches program some workouts. Watching them go through the process revealed some insight we would not have discovered otherwise. Their thought process and workflow was heavily considered in our design.</p>
          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>There were many things we wanted to accomplish with our system, which included the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Help coaches to program for their members</li>
            <li>Broadcast the programming to members</li>
            <li>Keep records of personal scores</li>
            <li>Visualize both individual and gym progress</li>
            <li>Create a mobile version with information tailored to that end (see here)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We prototyped in three iterations: paper, Balsamiq, and web. See the process in the presentation above.</p>
