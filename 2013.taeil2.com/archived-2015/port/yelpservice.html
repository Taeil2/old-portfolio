          <p>By looking at how many times the word "service" appeared in a business's Yelp reviews relative to the total number of reviews, you could get a rough idea of how important service is to that business. If you take this idea with a large enough data set, you can begin to see trends. I call this metric "service percentage."</p>
          <p>I compared service percentages across metrics that I thought were the most important factors in service, such as price and whether there was waiter service or not.</p>
          <p>What's most interesting to me is how service percentage is extremely accurate portraying the importance of service. It's a cool demonstration of what you can do with the power of words and data. It would have been even nicer to have an average rating for the reviews that contained the word "service" so that I could correlate bad or good service with these metrics.</p>
